1. email sending frequency cap
--> pretty heavy-handed instrument

--> combine it with the following:
* use "Last marketing email send date" and "Sends since last engagement" (in lists or workflows)
* use auto-unenrollment in workflow to prevent concurrent nurturing workflows

2. naming conventions
hierarchy of instruments:
1. content partitioning for hard separation "permission"
2. folders for hard separation ("visibility")
3. naming conventions for tag-based searches
